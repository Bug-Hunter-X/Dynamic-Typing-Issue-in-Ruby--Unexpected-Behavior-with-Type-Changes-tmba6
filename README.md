This repository demonstrates a subtle issue that can arise in Ruby due to its dynamic typing system.  The `bug.rb` file shows how assigning a string value to a variable previously holding a number doesn't raise an error. While this flexibility is a strength of Ruby, it can also lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors if not handled with care. The `bugSolution.rb` offers a way to mitigate this using explicit type checking or duck typing.
